My first task, is Brutus. In this Sherlock Scenario i try In this task, I wanted to guess who the attacker is, what his IP address is, what the attacker's name was, when he cracked the password, how the attack went and what he did. Finding the IP address was not a problem, in the logs it was written who tried to log in. By trial and error, he tried to break in. Which he eventually succeeded in, but thanks to that I had a clear picture of the attack. There were no problems with the username, similarly, he almost signed his work himself. An additional help was a file in binary code with the title, wtmp. Using the command in the Linux terminal using, xxd -b [filename]. I opened it and analyzed the time when the attacker logged in.
